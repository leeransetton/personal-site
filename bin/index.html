Once I was release from the army, I joined 
an aspiring startup in Israel that was based in Santa Monica, CA. There I started as a backend developer in a scalable, high-availability Java architecture. 
After a few months, I was asked to help the web team, that's where I learned everything I know today about web development. A year after I started, I was asked to 
relocate to the Santa Monica office, to which I agreed. 3 Months later I left and joined another company in the porn industry, there I'm a backend engineer working 
in PHP, JavaScript, NodeJS, GraphQL, and more.</p></div></div><div class="experience flex-container"><h1 class="heading">Experience</h1><h2 class="subheading divider"> "By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
